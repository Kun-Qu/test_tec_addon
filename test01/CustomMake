# Use this shell script to add to or replace various shell
# variables defined prior to this shell script's execution.
# The make program is called immediatly after processing 
# this shell script and the variables listed below are
# supplied to the make command.
#
# NOTE: Most of these have been set based on the current
#       value of $PLATFORM.  If you decide to modify one
#       of these it is best to do so based on the value of
#       $PLATFORM.
#
# This shell script is executed by Runmake.
#
# At this point assume the following variables are set:
#
#  $LIBBASENAME  ... Base name for the library to be created.
#  $CCOMP        ... Name of the c compiler 
#  $CPPCOMP      ... Name of the c++ compiler 
#  $FCOMP        ... Name of the fortran compiler 
#  $CFLAGS       ... flags for the c compiler 
#  $CPPFLAGS     ... flags for the c++ compiler 
#  $FFLAGS       ... flags for the fortran compiler
#  $LD           ... Name of the c and fortran linker
#  $CPPLD        ... Name of the c++ linker
#  $LDFLAGS      ... flags needed to link a c or fortran add-on using the $LD
#  $CPPLDFLAGS   ... flags needed to link a c++ add-on using the $CPPLD
#  $FLIBS        ... extra libraries needed to link fortran.
#  $ADDONLIBDIR  ... name of the directory where Add-On libraries are stored.
#  $TECLIBDIR    ... name of the directory where Tecplot libraries are stored.
#  $PLATFORM     ... current platform
#  $LIBEXT       ... extension used on shared object libraries for
#                    this platform.
#
#
#
# Example:  If $PLATFORM is "sgix.62" then add "-woff 1234" to the C compile flags:
#
#  if test "$PLATFORM" = "sgix.62" ; then
#    CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -woff 1234"
#  fi
